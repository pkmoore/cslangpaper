\section{Evaluation}
\label{SEC:evaluation}

Our evaluation seeks to answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Are inter and intra application anomalies a common source of
    bugs}

  \item{Are CSLang's models able to find bugs in real world applications?}

  \item{Is CSLang sufficiently powerful to describe a broad set of
    anomalies}

  \item{How hard is it to expand CSLang's model to support new
    communication formats?}

  \item{Are CSLang's transducers able to quickly process large
    communication streams?}

\end{itemize}
