\abstract{Earlier work has proven that information extracted from recordings of an
application’s activity can be tremendously valuable.
However, given the many requests  applications make to external entities, isolating the handful of patterns that indicate the
potential for failure has been difficult at best. In this paper we propose a new technique that can find bugs by utilizing
event processing techniques
proven to locate patterns in other domains. By creating PORT,
a new domain specific language, users can extract patterns in system call recordings and other streams,
and then rewrite input activity on the fly.
The former task can spot activity that indicates a bug,
while the latter produces a modified stream
for use in more active testing.
To test PORT's capabilities, we used it
to recreate the mutators and checkers
that the SEA project
employed to modify and replay
the results of system calls. Our
 re-implementations achieved the same
efficacy and better reliability using fewer lines of
code.
We further illustrated PORT’s extensibility
by supporting remote
procedure call traces,
and showing how PORT can be used
to detect malicious application behavior.}
