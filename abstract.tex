  Earlier work has demonstrated that there is tremendous value in
  information that can be extracted from an application's activity.
  The trick is in how to extract it.
  Applications often make hundreds or thousands of requests
  to external entities over the course of an execution
  which makes it difficult to recognize important patterns.
  Existing event processing applications,
  used successfully in fire alarms,
  industrial control systems,
  and computer network monitoring software,
  have emerged as a potential solution
  to this problem as,
  by design,
  these systems
  search
  incoming streams of events
  for a sequence,
  and
  react appropriately
  when it occurs.
  In this work,
  we apply how
  application actions
  can be processed like events for use in identifying bugs.
  What makes this possible
  is the creation of
  a new domain specific language
  called CSlang
  which allows users
  to not only construct a program that describes an activity,
  but can also rewrite an input activity stream on the fly
  to produce a modified stream
  that can be used for more active testing.
  Using CSlang makes it easy
  to identify sequences
  in streams like event logs,
  remote procedure call traces,
  or system call activity.
  For example, we employed CSlang
  to recreate the ``anomalies''
  used in
  the SEA technique,
  a project introduced in 2019
  that was able to find bugs
  by modifying and replaying the results of
  an application's system calls.
  In turn, we were able to use
  these anomalies
  to test AAA applications
  chosen from the Debian popularity contest
  and found YYY new bugs in ZZZ
  applications.
  %%%
  %Further, in order to illustrate CSlang's flexibility,
  %we produced programs that can
  %transform
  %logged network traffic into firewall rules.
  %These programs were able to identify common network attacks
  %and block offending IP addresses.
  %%%%
  %Finally,
  We further utilized this mechanism
  to create programs that
  could generate test cases
  by examining and rewriting the contents of
  remote procedure calls.
  Using these programs we improved the test suites
  of YYY applications identifying ZZZ new bugs in the process
  and improving code coverage by AA\%.
