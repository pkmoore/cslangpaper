  This work presents CSlang,
  a new domain specific language
  for processing application activity streams
  like event logs,
  remote procedure call traces,
  or system call activity.
  CSlang's key feature
  is the ease with which users
  can construct programs
  capable of
  recognizing important application activity
  and taking action
  when it appears.
  %%%
  This is accomplished by first transforming the incoming activity stream
  into a format-agnostic representation.
  The stream is then processed by an enhanced finite-state transducer that
  makes modifications described by the CSlang program.
  Finally, the modified stream is output in the format required by its
  intended use case.
  %%%
  As earlier work on the SEA technique,
  introduced in 2019,
  showed success at finding bugs
  using similar capabilities,
  we used CSlang to recreate that
  project's ``anomalies.''
  We employed them
  in evaluating AAA applications
  chosen from the Debian popularity contest
  and found YYY new bugs in ZZZ
  applications.
  %%%
  Further, in order to illustrate CSlang's flexibility
  we used its type system
  and data model
  to produce programs that can
  transform logged network traffic into firewall rules.
  These programs were able to identify common network attacks
  and block offending IP addresses using iptables.
  %%%
  Finally,
  we created programs that could examine
  the contents of remote procedure calls,
  and modify them in order to generate test cases
  for the receiving application.
